### Design choices
- The style is responsive with viewport size.  
This means that when you do view desktop on mobile in safari, it will not change the page.  
I chose to do this because there is no need for two seperate css stylesheets as it will cause more difficulty when changing things in the future.

- The style of the website is a dark theme.  
I like dark theme.  
Maybe I'll make it optional later.
